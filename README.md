### What is this repository for? ###

** Summary:** While working on large development projects, all software developers eventually find themselves in a position where working in groups appears to be more productive. With software projects involving a multitude of developers this almost becomes a crucial part of project development. A real time collaborative integrated development environment can provide developers with the facility to collaborate over software projects over a network even when developers are thousand of miles away. Real-time Collaborative IDE provide developers with the ability to collaboratively write code, build and test it as well as share their projects with other developers. Chatting with other fellow developers over a project is also possible. Besides several other useful features of a complete IDE including saving snapshots, project management are also provided to ease the entire project development process.

**Version:** 1.0
